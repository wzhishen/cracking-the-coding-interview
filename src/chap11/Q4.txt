Imagine you have a 20 GB file with one string per line. Explain how you would sort
the file.

SOLUTION

Divide the file into N chunks which are x megabytes each, where x is the amount of
memory we have available. Each chunk is sorted separately and then saved back to the
file system. Once all the chunks are sorted, we then merge the chunks according to the
following algorithm:

1. Divide your memory into (N+1) parts. First N parts are used to read data from N chunks,
   the last one is used as a buffer.
2. Load data to fill the first N data parts from N chunks respectively, perform an N-way
   merge sort to the buffer.
3. While any data part is not empty, perform the sort.
4. If any data part is empty, load new content from the corresponding chunk.
5. If the buffer is full, write buffer to the disk as output file, clear buffer.
6. Repeat step 4-5 until all N chunks and buffer are empty.

At the end, we have output that is fully sorted on the disk.
This algorithm is known as *external sort*.
