Imagine you have a 20 GB file with one string per line. Explain how you would sort
the file.

SOLUTION:
Divide the file into chunks which are x megabytes each, where x is the amount of
memory we have available. Each chunk is sorted separately and then saved back to the
file system.
Once all the chunks are sorted, we then merge the chunks, one by one. At the end, we
have a fully sorted file.
This algorithm is known as external sort.
